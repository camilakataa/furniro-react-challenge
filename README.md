## Challenge

This challenge is from Compass UOL for the interns to complete and learn experiences. The main objective was to build a front-end development based on the design in Figma.<br>
To accomplish this task, it was used React with TypeScript application.

Furniro is a fictional furniture store with all categories of furniture products, from sofas to tables. <br>
This project contains the home page, with information about the Furniro shopping. <br>

To run this application, it's necessary to clone this repository and install all the dependencies (wich can be seen in [*tools content*](#tools)).<br> 
To run the JSON server, it's necessary to use the command "npx json-server ./mock/_database.json" to access the mock api.

## Difficulties

While developing this web page, I faced some challenges that helped me to learn experience. Here are some examples:

- To create the Donate and Adopt Modals: I was not familiar to the tag < dialog >, and I had to do a search about how it works and how to open and close the Modals
- To style the radio inputs in the payment method in the Donate Modal: Basic, I had to disable the appearance of the input and do a style in the label, increasing the hit area to select the radio.
- The forms validation: To prevent the forms being submitted without the correct information, I had to manipulate the input values with regular expressions (regex), which was something new for me. With the correct pattern, the forms can be submitted.
- This project don't have mobile version: The responsive design was optional and I didn't have time to do it, so I intend to do it later.

These experiences and more that I didn't list taught me valuable lessons in adaptability and perseverance, enhancing my web delevopment skills.
