## Challenge

This challenge is from Compass UOL for the interns to complete and learn experiences. The main objective was to build a front-end development based on the design in Figma.<br>
To accomplish this task, it was used React with TypeScript application.<br>

Furniro is a fictional furniture store with all categories of furniture products, from sofas to tables. <br>
This project contains the home page, with information about the Furniro shopping.<br>

To run this application, it's necessary to clone this repository and install all the dependencies (wich can be seen in [*tools content*](#tools)).<br>
To run the JSON server, it's necessary to use the command "npm run server" to access the mock api.

## Figma

The challenge was based accordingly to the design and user interface in ðŸ”—[Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/E1F9AbyIRppkO2Ro1oP2tj/Desafio-3?node-id=117-336&t=kFuD7FGniomCe5mR-0)

## Difficulties

While developing this web page, I faced some challenges that helped me to learn experience. Here are some examples:

- The production timeline posed a challenge. I had to organize the tasks, starting with those I was more familiar with and then moving on to the more detailed tasks;
- The authentication task was new for me, so I took some time to register the users and to verify the logins in Firebase;
- To do the mock using JSON Server was a challenge and also took some time to complete with all the products, but I had help from others colleagues;
- To use the context to implement the Shopping Cart with the functions to add and to remove items, it's an achievement

These experiences and more that I didn't list taught me valuable lessons in adaptability and perseverance, enhancing my web delevopment skills.
